##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: December, 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through a MOOC about Python Classes using getter and setter with property.
I learned 3 special methods to implement in a class to use fancy ability of python. The `__len__(self)` to be able to do `len(instance)`, the `__contains__(self, item)` to use `item in instance` and the `__str__(self)` to use `print(instance)`

**Thoughts** I'm amazed to see how better the getter and setter concept is implemented in Python than C++ for example. I'm starting to understand more and find it more easily to use the concept of Classes.
