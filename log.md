### Day 1: December, 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through a MOOC about Python Classes using getter and setter with property.
I learned 3 special methods to implement in a class to use fancy ability of python. The `__len__(self)` to be able to do `len(instance)`, the `__contains__(self, item)` to use `item in instance` and the `__str__(self)` to use `print(instance)`
I also did a list challenge on HackerRank website

**Thoughts** I'm amazed to see how better the getter and setter concept is implemented in Python than C++ for example. I'm starting to understand more and find it more easily to use the concept of Classes.

### Day 2: December, 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Following my classes learning, I discovered that `__eq__(self, other)` and `__hash__(self)`are usefull if you want to control the p == q test between your instances and the way your object is stored as a key in a dictionnary. I went through the Learn Python: Classes section in CodeAcademy.
A list of all the [special method names](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#specialnames)

**Thoughts** I like to see how easy it is to handle those very usefull mechanism.

### Day 3: December 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I continue with my classes tutorial. I've been practicing class inheritance and the concept of implicit, explicit and redefined method. Using a [namedtuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple) (a function that returns a class) or a @dataclass (frozen=True) you can easily create an immutable class.

**Thoughts:** A concept that took me long time to understand with C++ seems much more easier, and I quickly see how I could use all of this !

### Day 4: December 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Training about multiple class inheritance, if you do class C(SuperA, SuperB) it will first look attributs in C, then SuperA then SuperB. You can find the order by calling the C.mro() method !

**Thoughts:** I'm happy to see I can commit even on christmas day !

[Back Top](#days)

----
### Day 5: December 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I did some exercise with multiple class inheritance. I also did my Pre Assessment test for the deeplearning nanodegres MOOC. Result are : Differential Calculus = 50% / Linear Algebra = 42% / Python = 72% / Algebra = 83%. They said that I am **modederately prepared** ahah. I will need to do more mathematics to follow up.
The scope resolution LEGB rule is important to know:
* Local(L): Defined inside function/class
* Enclosed(E): Defined inside enclosing functions(Nested function concept)
* Global(G): Defined at the uppermost level
* Built-in(B): Reserved names in Python builtin modules

This creates a special case to be aware of :
```
a = 1
class C:
  a = 3
  def f(self):
    print(a)
ins = C()
ins.f()
```
 
Following the LEGB rule, there are no local `a` variable in the function f, there are no enclosed function, and yes, there is a global variable called a. In this scenario the print(a) will print 1. the bloc a=3 in the class will be skipped. To avoid it and print 3 you must write print(self.a)

**Thoughts:** Not much today, I feel that a lot of work is coming on, this journey. Still 1000% motivated :)

### Day 6: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I am taking a quick GIT course on codeacademy so I can start tracking all my progress for my course projects on github. I am also doing a free course on Data Analyst to learn pandas and numpy python library as Udacity is recommending me for the Deep Learning nanodegree course. 
Creating your own exception is very easy:
```
class MyOwnError(Exception):
  pass
```
That's it ! The convention is to add Error at the end of your own error, and it must inherits from Exception.

**Thoughts:** I used git before, but it was like 3 years ago.. I forgot most of it but I'm happy to see it's coming back quickly ! I also found a very nice log.md from someone doing the 100DaysOfCode challenge and I implemented nice ideas from his on my log.md. Made me learn some markdown stuff

### Day 7: December 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: This morning I did one hour of algebra to understand better how the derrivative of a function works. I practiced using conda to install and create virtual environments.
I discovered that to install old version of some packages you need to add the channel conda-forge:
`conda config --add channels conda-forge`
I also found an error in my Udacity course and I've been trying options to fix it by myself since a few hours. I improved my bash (I use ZSH) so I can see which conda virtual environment is active.

**Thoughts:** I lost myself a bit today, jumping from subject to another but I'm happy to see the progress I still did.

### Day 8: December 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I discovered a few projects that uses machine learning. I worked for 2 hours on the final project of FunMOOC about Python. I had to write one missing file out of 3 already written. It was about creating classes and definning the proper methods and algorithm. I trained a bit with Git as well on CodeAcademy, and I did some mathematic classes about limits and algebra this morning.

**Thoughts:** I didnt perfect the exercise but I'm quite happy of my ability to get through this !

### Day 9: December 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I developped my first tool to the community. A [log maker for the 100 days of code challenge](https://github.com/MattiooFR/log-maker-100-days). It automatically creates the whole 100 days in a pretty form with a sort of a calendar with all the inline links done to jump instantly to any wanted day. I finished a little pokemon project on codeacademy to train myself with using classes.

**Thoughts:** I am so happy I did this. I just woke up this morning and I knew I had to do this because it would first help me not to do all the calendar with the link to each day by hand, and then it could help other to instantly create the same log.md ! I'm so happy it took me only 1h to do something good enough and I already so new features I could implement in the future !

### Day 10: December 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I found out that if I want to install an older version of python with pyenv, I have a problem with openSSL lib. Homebrew is using the version 1.1 and it is not compatible with all python version. To make it work first I need to uninstall the faulting openSSL version with 'https://github.com/MattiooFR/log-maker-100-days' and then I can try again with pyenv install 3.4.0 and tadaaaa, it works.
In python 3.8 you can use this new operator := called the walrus operator. It allows you to test and assign a value in the same line. Example :
```
if ((n:=len([1,2,3,4])) > 2):
  print(n) # it print 4
```
The parenthesis surrounding (n:=value)>test are important !

**Thoughts:** Installing an older version of python comes because someone got an error trying my lib and I suspect it is because I used the f-string that are only for python above 3.6. It makes me want to make my code compatible for the most, so I might change the f-string to regular "blabla".format() and prevent people for having to update their python to make it works (even if updating is kind of important people ! :p)

### Day 11: January, 01, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished my codeacademy course on python. It was about arguments in function, positional, optional, default, \*args, and \*\*kwargs. I also tried the exercism.io website and did the first two python exercises.

**Thoughts:** It's hard to work the day after new years eve lol but well, a challenge is a challenge ! I was not feeling the best at learning things today so I preferred to do some exercises. The exercism.io concept is super cool ! You code on your editor and when your code pass the tests that are already written you can then publish on the website, and in the next day a "mentor" is going to review your code for free and you can learn from it ! Super cool !

### Day 12: January, 02, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished a course on git (version control manager) and learned a few useful command like `git log --oneline`, all about the branchs and merging process and how to undo ou modify commits with `git commit --amend`, `git reset --mixed|soft|hard HEAD^1`. I worked for a few hours on my [log maker repo](https://github.com/MattiooFR/log-maker-100-days/) to add features suggested by others like choosing the duration, filename, using dateparser library to understand dates like `yesterday`. I did a course on deep learning and I slowly start to understand how it is working !

**Thoughts:** I love git and I'm getting more and more used to it ! I'm so happy to see how my personnal project motivated someone to help me ! It makes it move fast !

### Day 13: January, 03, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did my first merging from a pull request of my project [log maker repo] (https://github.com/MattiooFR/log-maker-100-days/). I fixed some bugs in the resulting code and updated the readme.
I spend the rest of the day learning about deep learning. I learned the logistic regression model with gradial descent algorithm. I applied some of this knowledge to a partial built code and ran my first deep learning algorithm to classify red dots from blue dots.

**Thoughts:** Accepting the pull request was an historical moment in my developper life ! As well as applying deeplearning in the prebuilt code was an historical moment for my deap learning programmer career ahah

### Day 14: January, 04, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the codeacademy course on git, it was about the commands for working in collaboration git fetch, git branch, git merge, git push. Continiuing my journey to become a deep learning programmer on udacity, I learned new models of neural networks with a sigmoid function, feedforward and backpropagation.

**Thoughts:** Nothing special today

### Day 15: January, 05, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I solved the [raindrop](https://exercism.io/my/solutions/976b9d6316a94d929f8dcee9f9fee1f4) and [armstrong numbers](https://exercism.io/my/solutions/a4a80d70532c417e847b5081f4a9ff87) exercises, check them out they can be asked during interviews ! I did 1h of algebra solving on [khanacademy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics) and 1h of [vector](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces/linear-combinations/v/linear-combinations-and-span?modal=1) course. I subscribed on [kaggle](kaggle.com), a data science challenges website ! I implemented code for Gradient Descent and calculating the error, the prediction y, and updating the weights of a neural networks. I also did some codeacademy course about List comprehension and Lambda function.

**Thoughts:** I heard its good to practice yourself on kaggle (once you are good enough ofc), it can helps a lot for recognition and finding a job ! I went through a complex article about using [momentum](https://distill.pub/2017/momentum/) in deep learning and it really scared me how complex the mathematics can become ! But I'm more motivated than before to get better at all this ! Hurrayy

### Day 17: January, 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Quick update, I take a flight to Finland in 9 hours, where I will be staying for 3 month, full time learning to code !
I still had the time this morning to do mathematics and deep learning course, nothing special...

**Thoughts:** Not much time today, I'm happy I woke up early so I could do enough stuff today ! Big travellign day tomorrow...

### Day 18: January, 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my log generator project. I implemented a feature to generate the same log but in HTML.

**Thoughts:** It was hard to find time today to be productive as I was moving from France to Finland and couldnt sleep only two hours this night, but I'm happy to see I still managed to implement something usefull !

### Day 19: January, 09, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a class TriangleRectangle that can calculate all sides lenght and angles from a TriangleRectangle, no matter how many are missing (with a limit obviously). It can also create a vector out of a triangle rectangle, and add or subtract with another one.

**Thoughts:** I was doing some KhanAcademy exercises about vector, and one using trangle rectangle was annoying me so much that I decided to use python to create an algorithm that would calculate everything for me. It took me 5 hours but I finally did it ! YEAH

### Day 20: January, 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my log manager project by fixing a commit from someone on the branch that will implement the feature to update a log that has missing days by removing and adding them at the end. I coded a bit of deep learning algorithm following my course. I solved some codewars exercises.

**Thoughts:** I feel a bit overwhelmed by all the stuff I'm working on, I think I need to refocus a bit the next days.

### Day 21: January, 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: After watching 3 hours of Stanford course on deep learning, I started and finished my first deep learning project of my udacity nanodegree. I also did some exercises with pandas library on codeacademy.

**Thoughts:** I'm so happy I managed to finish the project in one day ! It was not too hard because lots of things were already done but well, I can see that I'm understanding more and more how those things work.

### Day 22: January, 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I got back on my Fun MOOC with some exercise and learning numpy and pandas. I didnt know about the command np.any and np.all. I find some interesting articles about deep learning, I also subscribed to great newsletter and found websites that share news about this are to start cultivate my knowledge.

**Thoughts:** Numpy is super powerful, the vector calculus and things like np.sump(np > 0) are awesome !

### Day 23: January, 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was mostly about deep learning and learning numpy. I did a few online class and exercise with numpy. I spend the whole evening following my deep learning udacity course, doing a movie review classification project to predict if a review is a positive review or a negative review.
The first idea was to compute the count of each words in a review and plug this as inputs for the neural network and train it by saying if the review with this list of words was positive, or negative. We could achieve a 65% positive prediction like this, but it is not enough. The second way to improve the learning is to look at the data. We saw that the biggest counted words were ' ', '.', 'the' and other words like this, whereas interesting words to predict positiveness or negativeness have only 1 count. By changing the input words by just 1 or 0 instead of the count, we jumped to 85% of positive prediction after 1 training.
The next step to improve our neural network is to fasten the training process. We are removing useless calculation in the hidden layers, there is 72000 inputs so getting even small amount of speed makes a huge impact on the total speed.

**Thoughts:** I'm so happy to see another real application of neural networks that is working so well. I got stuck for a few hours on building the code for the neural network because it was much more empty than the previous project, but well, this is how you learn right !

### Day 24: January, 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: A few exercises on pandas library. Merged a branch dev by someonelse on master of my log generator project. I started working on handling the new update feature for html log but it felt too fuzzy here to start.

**Thoughts:** Probably the day I worked the less efficiently ! I'm not happy today !

### Day 25: January, 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Sentiment Machine Learning Project, did some course on pandas on fun mooc and code academy.

**Thoughts:** I'm keeping on my different online course. I also downloaded a bunch of math books to catch up with my lacking in this area.

### Day 26: January, 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started my course on pytorch on my Deep Learning nanodegree on Udacity. I also started a course on mathematics for Machine Learning on Coursera. It was about linear algebra. I finished the work for week 1 in one day. I finished the linear equation and graphs on Khan Academy. 

**Thoughts:** I need to change the way I'm writting this log because I do it at the end of the day, and I realize that I am summarizing too much because I forgot the details. Pytorch seems really really interesting and easy to handle. Pytorch has all the tools of numpy and we just scratched the surface ! I'm surprise how I was good to answer all the quizz on the linear algebra course, seems I didnt forget that much since High School. I'm also continuing Khan Academy. I'm aiming to finish all the course in mathematics, starting from Algebra I so I'll build up solid fundations in math. I'm going to start reading a book on Mathematics called The Joy of X (not a porn book lol) written by Steven Strogatz. I also started an excel file where I'll write down every book, video, article, course that I do day by day to have a solid history of what took me from 0 to Data Scientist.

### Day 27: January, 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I'm doing some linear algebra classes. The dot product is vector(a) . vector(b) = ax x bx + ay x by ... or = ||vector(a)|| x cos(θ) x ||vector(b)||. I did exercises with scalar projection and vector projection. I continued in my deep learning nanodegree by learning how to use and create a neural network with Pytorch. The project we used with pytorch was about training a model to recognize number from 0 to 9. We used nn module of pytorch to easily create a model, update the hidden layers, and get the output. We used the optim module of pytorch to update the weights from the gradients calculated automatically from the autograd feature. 

**Thoughts:** I want to strongly understand what a dot product, scalar and vector projections are. Took me a few hours but I think this is a concept I know well now. Pytorch seems awesome I have to say. It shorten the amount of code needed, and simplifies a lot what you need to know. I think its important to now the basic so you are able to be even better with tools that just makes your writing of code faster.
