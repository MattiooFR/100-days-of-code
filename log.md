### Day 1: December, 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through a MOOC about Python Classes using getter and setter with property.
I learned 3 special methods to implement in a class to use fancy ability of python. The `__len__(self)` to be able to do `len(instance)`, the `__contains__(self, item)` to use `item in instance` and the `__str__(self)` to use `print(instance)`
I also did a list challenge on HackerRank website

**Thoughts** I'm amazed to see how better the getter and setter concept is implemented in Python than C++ for example. I'm starting to understand more and find it more easily to use the concept of Classes.

### Day 2: December, 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Following my classes learning, I discovered that `__eq__(self, other)` and `__hash__(self)`are usefull if you want to control the p == q test between your instances and the way your object is stored as a key in a dictionnary. I went through the Learn Python: Classes section in CodeAcademy.

**Thoughts** I like to see how easy it is to handle those very usefull mechanism.
